The need for Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) depends on two factors: the worker's immune status and the source's infectiousness.\n**Immune Status:** An Anti-HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody) level **> 10 MIU/ml** is considered protective.

No treatment is needed.\n**b:** The worker is **not immune** (Anti-HBs < 10) and was exposed to an **infectious source** (HBsAg positive).

(True):** Checking the Anti-HBs titre 1-2 months after completing the vaccine series is the standard procedure to confirm if the person has successfully seroconverted and is now immune.\n**b. (True):** HBIG provides passive immunity (antibodies from an external source). If you test the worker's blood too soon after giving HBIG, you will detect the *passive* antibodies, not the worker's *own* immune response. You must wait 4-6 months for the passive antibodies to clear before testing for their active response.\n**c. (False):** This statement is incorrect. If a worker is exposed, the *source patient* is tested for HBsAg immediately to determine if PEP is needed. Testing the *worker* for HBsAg immediately after exposure is useless, as the disease is still in its incubation period. The worker's HBsAg status *before* the exposure might be checked as a baseline, but the immediate action is testing the source.\n**d. (True):** An unvaccinated person who is exposed to an HBsAg positive source needs baseline testing and then follow-up testing (typically at 6 months) to see if they develop the infection (become HBsAg positive) or develop antibodies from infection (Anti-HBc positive).",

(False):** The first dose of the Rotavirus vaccine has a strict upper age limit (generally 15 weeks, 0 days) and should *not* be started after that due to a theoretical, small increased risk of intussusception.\n**e. (True):** This is a specific rule for the \"Polio 0\" (birth) dose.
