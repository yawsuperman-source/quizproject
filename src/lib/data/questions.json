The need for Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) depends on two factors: the worker's immune status and the source's infectiousness.\n**Immune Status:** An Anti-HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody) level **> 10 MIU/ml** is considered protective.

No treatment is needed.\n**b:** The worker is **not immune** (Anti-HBs < 10) and was exposed to an **infectious source** (HBsAg positive).

(True):** Checking the Anti-HBs titre 1-2 months after completing the vaccine series is the standard procedure to confirm if the person has successfully seroconverted and is now immune.\n**b. (True):** HBIG provides passive immunity (antibodies from an external source). If you test the worker's blood too soon after giving HBIG, you will detect the *passive* antibodies, not the worker's *own* immune response. You must wait 4-6 months for the passive antibodies to clear before testing for their active response.\n**c. (False):** This statement is incorrect. If a worker is exposed, the *source patient* is tested for HBsAg immediately to determine if PEP is needed. Testing the *worker* for HBsAg immediately after exposure is useless, as the disease is still in its incubation period. The worker's HBsAg status *before* the exposure might be checked as a baseline, but the immediate action is testing the source.\n**d. (True):** An unvaccinated person who is exposed to an HBsAg positive source needs baseline testing and then follow-up testing (typically at 6 months) to see if they develop the infection (become HBsAg positive) or develop antibodies from infection (Anti-HBc positive).",

    "subjectId": "internal-medicine",
    "explanation": "This question asks which test is irrelevant to a PUD workup.\n**a. Full blood count (FBC):** This is essential. A low hemoglobin would indicate anemia, a common and serious complication of a bleeding ulcer.\nb. H. pylori stool antigen: This is a key non-invasive test to check for *H. pylori*, the most common cause of PUD2.\n\nc. Endoscopy: This is the \"gold standard\" investigation to directly visualize the ulcer, check for malignancy, and test for *H. pylori*3.\n\n**d. Stool for routine examination (Stool RE):** This is a reasonable test. It can be used to check for occult blood (unseen blood from a bleeding ulcer) or to help rule out other causes of abdominal pain, like parasites.\n**e. Rapid diagnostic test for malaria:** This test is for malaria, an infectious disease with symptoms like fever, chills, and body aches. These symptoms do not overlap with the classic presentation of PUD (epigastric pain related to meals). Therefore, it is not an important investigation for this patient.",

These varices are fragile and prone to rupture, causing **life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding**. Therefore, chronic hepatitis *causes* this bleeding, it does not *protect* from it.\nAs the liver fails (decompensated cirrhosis), it can no longer clear toxins like ammonia, leading to **hepatic encephalopathy** (d).\nChronic inflammation and cirrhosis are the strongest risk factors for developing liver cancer, known as **hepatocellular carcinoma** (e).",

    "explanation": "Lactulose has a dual mechanism, but its primary role relates to option (a):\n**Laxative Effect:** It's a laxative that speeds up intestinal transit, flushing out ammonia and the bacteria that produce it.\n**Ion Trapping:** It is metabolized by gut bacteria into lactic acid, which **acidifies** the colon (making option 'e' incorrect). This acidic environment converts absorbable ammonia (NH3) into non-absorbable ammonium (NH4+), which is then trapped in the stool and excreted.
