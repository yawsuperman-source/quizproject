    "options": [
      "'object'",
      "'null'",
      "'undefined'",
      "'string'"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "'object'",
    "explanation": "This is a long-standing bug in JavaScript. The `typeof` operator returns 'object' for `null` due to how JavaScript was originally implemented. `null` is a primitive value, but this quirk remains for historical reasons."

      "Symbol",
      "BigInt",
      "Tuple",
      "Undefined"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Tuple",
    "explanation": "JavaScript has several primitive data types: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Symbol, and Null. 'Tuple' is a data structure in other languages like Python and TypeScript, but not a primitive type in JavaScript."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A syntax extension for JavaScript",
    "explanation": "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. Babel transpiles JSX into `React.createElement()` calls."

    "correctAnswer": "Using props",
    "explanation": "Props (short for properties) are the primary way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Data flows one way in React, from parent to child."

      "Smaller bundle sizes",
      "Easier state management"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Improved SEO and initial page load",
    "explanation": "SSR pre-renders the page on the server, sending fully-formed HTML to the browser. This allows search engine crawlers to easily index the content and improves the perceived performance for users on initial load."

      "It includes padding and border in the element's total width and height.",
      "It makes the element a flex container.",
      "It adds a shadow to the box.",
      "It changes the element's display to block."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "It includes padding and border in the element's total width and height.",
    "explanation": "By default, an element's width and height are calculated as `content`. `border-box` tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height."
