Asterixis is easily elicited.\n**Grade 3** is a severe stage where the patient is very sleepy, difficult to rouse (**stuporous**), but *can* still be aroused by stimuli. When awake, they are markedly confused, may be aggressive, and unable to speak clearly (inarticulate speech).\n**Grade 4** is defined as **Coma **(being unresponsive), where the patient is *unarousable*.",

Antibiotics is the mainstay treatment \nThis is not true — and thus the correct answer to the question. Antibiotics are not routinely used in childhood diarrhea and may even worsen outcomes if used unnecessarily.\n• \tc. Fluid loss occurs quickly compared to adults \nTrue. Children have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio and lower fluid reserves, making them more vulnerable to dehydration.\n• \td. The commonest complication is dehydration \nTrue. Dehydration is the most serious and frequent complication of diarrhea in children and can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.\n• \te.
